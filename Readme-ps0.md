# PS0: Hello SFML

## Contact
Name:Jason Ossai

Section:

Time to Complete: A week plus


## Description
In this project you are basically meant to run with your build environment

### Features
My major decisions were actually setting up my SFML using the hello world code, in which I had to draw and make the sprite respond to commands

### Issues
The test for my screenshot.png failed, my lint tests failed also, which had a total of 17 errors.  

### Extra Feature
I installed python and cpplint using command features, I also created my directory for ps0 and enlisted five files in it.

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.  

I think without  authorization from the teacher, using generative AI technologies like chatbots, picture generators, or code generators to finish homework, tests, or other academic tasks. This includes using AI tools to create answers to assignment or exam questions, submitting content created by AI as original work, and neglecting to provide disclosure when necessary about the use of AI in submission creation. This is the most common misconduct we have in computer science today, lots of people tend to use ai tools like chat gpt especially, coursehero, github to extract codes for assignments and use it as their own without citation or reference.


## Acknowledgements
I asked my instructor for help with this ps0, as I had confusing on which files to submit. I also asked James daily for help with the general idea of the project and necessary items to submit, I didn't even know we had to submit a documentation on the project before he told me.

### Credits
I got my sprite image on google by simply searching for pictures of standing cats and downloaded it to my pc. Here is a link to it :
